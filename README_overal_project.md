# Healthcare Data Portfolio

## Overview
This portfolio demonstrates my skills across the healthcare data lifecycle:
- **Data Engineering**: Building ETL pipelines from FHIR/claims data into a warehouse
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Creating dashboards and reports for healthcare KPIs
- **Advanced Analytics**: Performing cost, cohort, and population health analysis
- **Machine Learning**: Predicting readmission risk from patient encounters
- **End-to-End Projects**: Connecting ETL → analytics → ML → dashboards
- **Bonus NLP**: Extracting insights from synthetic clinical notes

The goal is to showcase my ability to work with healthcare data in real-world scenarios, from ingestion and transformation to advanced analytics and visualization.
